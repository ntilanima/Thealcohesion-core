Decision Tree & Outcomes on landing.html

Following the "handshake" with the vpu-bridge.js, the system makes one of four critical decisions:
Outcome	Trigger Condition	System Action
IDENTITY_REVOKED	revoked flag is TRUE in the database.	Panic Triggered: Red HUD overlay appears, an audible alarm plays, and triggerRealPanic is executed to lock the VPU.
PROVISIONED	enclave_attested is TRUE and a user_name is linked.	Bypass Ingress: The sniffer recognizes the machine as a trusted device and automatically redirects to the main OS kernel (index.html).
ARCH_LOCKED	The machine's OS matches an existing bound architecture for that identity.	Access Denied: Prevents "Architecture Duplication" where one identity tries to claim multiple machines of the same OS type.
INITIAL_PROVISION	No record found in the database.	Auto-Registration: The bridge logs the hardware hash as a "CANDIDATE" and admits the user to the provisioning terminal (download.html).
Security Observations

    Forensic Buffer: The sniffer uses artificial delays (e.g., 800ms for "ISOLATING_HARDWARE_SIG") to ensure the user perceives the depth of the security check.

    Bridge Resiliency: If the bridge is offline, the sniffer catches the fetch error and displays "BRIDGE_OFFLINE" rather than crashing the frontend.

    Silent Enrollment: If a machine is unknown, it is silently inserted into the security_device table with enclave_attested = FALSE, allowing administrators to review new candidates.





Technical Breakdown of the Gates
1. The Sniffer Decision (landing.js & vpu-bridge.js)

    The sniffer captures a hardware fingerprint using generateLocalFingerprint() and sends it to the bridge.

    The bridge queries the security_device table (linked to the person table via person_id).

    If the user is found but marked as is_frozen in the person table, the sniffer rejects the probe entirely.

2. The Approval Loop (waiting-approval.html)

    While on this page, the frontend polls the /api/spacs/check-status endpoint.

    The bridge checks the identity_state for the person bound to that hardware.

    If the state is 'ACTIVE' or 'verified', the bridge returns status: 'APPROVED', triggering the jump to /complete-profile.html.

3. The Provisioning Handshake (complete-profile.html)

    This is the "Final Sync" gate.

    Once bio-data and a password hash are saved to the person and person_security tables, the provision_stage is updated to 'COMPLETE'.

    This transition allows the Sniffer to finally authorize entry to /Thealcohesion-core/index.html.

4. Security Enforcement (vpu-bridge.js)

    If the bound_machine_id in the person table does not match the machineFingerprint sent during login, the system increments failed_attempts.

    After 3 failed hardware matches, the is_frozen flag is set to TRUE, locking the identity out of all target URLs.
